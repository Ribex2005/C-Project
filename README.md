This is a simple console-based Rock, Paper & Scissors game written in the C programming language.
This was the very first project of my coding journey, created during my first year of college.
The player selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer makes a random choice.
The game compares both choices and displays whether the player won, lost, or drew.
Randomness is generated using the rand() function.
Game logic is implemented through if-else statements and a switch case.
The code uses basic input/output operations and infinite loops for continuous play.
The project helped me understand core C concepts like functions, loops, and conditionals.
It runs in the terminal and exits when the player selects the "Exit" option.
Though very basic, this project marks the beginning of my programming journey.
